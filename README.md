# Challenge
'''This is going to be a significant challenge.''
'''Well, this challenge has three areas to measure my skills. The first one is about Data Science technical skills, and the second and the third challenges are about "Technical writing" and personal questions that will help me get to know myself.

### 1. Data Science technical skills:
'''I am using [Ubuntu OS 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/).
'''So, now we are going to create a workspace for our machine learning project.
'''Go to the terminal and type the following commands:''
```sh
$ export ML_PATH= "$HOME/ml"      #you can change the path if you prefer
$ mkdir -p $ML_PATH
```
